# M2-a: Cluster Setup

## Docker Build and Run

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

## Container access

```bash
docker exec -it hadoop-master /bin/bash
```

- master node 접속

## Web UI

![NameNode Web UI](./imgs/NameNode.png)
![Resource Manager Web UI](./imgs/ResourceManager.png)

## Component Check

```bash
jps
```

## Check Connection

```bash
ssh hadoop-slave1
```

hadoop-master에서 실행 시 hadoop-slave1에 접속할 수 있다.

- jps 명령어를 통해 각각의 master, slave 별로 떠 있는 구성요소를 확인할 수 있다.
  이는 java virtual machine 목록을 보여주는 명령어이다.

# HDFS Operation

## File put

```bash
hdfs dfs -put input.txt /w3/m2/
```

## File Replication 확인(Distributed 확인)

```bash
hdfs fsck /w3/m2/input.txt -files -blocks -locations
```

## MapReduce Job

```bash
hadoop jar /usr/local/hadoop/share/hadoop/mapreduce/hadoop-mapreduce-examples-*.jar wordcount /w3/m2/input.txt /w3/m2/output
```

## Result

```bash
hdfs dfs -cat /w3/m2/output/part-r-00000
```
